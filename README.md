- **Basic programming knowledge** (variables, functions, control structures)

### Installation

1. **Install Go** using Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install go
   ```

2. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   go version
   ```

3. **Check Go environment**:
   ```bash
   go env GOPATH
   go env GOROOT
   ```

## How to Follow This Book

### **Learning Approach**
- **Read each chapter** in order (they build on each other)
- **Run the examples** using `go run main.go` in each chapter folder
- **Experiment** with the code - modify values, add new features

- **Practice** by building small projects

### **Chapter Structure**
Each chapter contains:
- **`main.go`** - Run this to see the concepts in action
- **`README.md`** - Detailed explanations and examples

## üõ†Ô∏è Essential Go Commands

### **Basic Commands**
```bash
go version          # Check Go version
go run main.go      # Run a Go program
go build main.go    # Compile to executable
go mod init name    # Initialize a new module
go mod tidy         # Clean up dependencies
```

### **Development Commands**
```bash
go fmt .            # Format code
go vet .            # Check for common mistakes
go test ./...       # Run tests
go doc package      # View package documentation
```

## üí° Learning Tips

### **1. Practice Regularly**
- Code every day, even if just for 15 minutes
- Modify examples to see what happens
- Build small projects using what you've learned

### **2. Understand Go's Philosophy**
- **Simplicity** - Go favors simple, readable code
- **Explicit** - No hidden magic, everything is clear
- **Efficient** - Fast compilation and execution
- **Safe** - Built-in safety features prevent common mistakes

### **3. Read the Code**
- Study the examples in each chapter
- Understand why each line exists
- Experiment with changing values and seeing results

### **4. Build Projects**
- Start with simple programs
- Gradually increase complexity
- Use real-world scenarios to practice

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **"go: command not found"**
   - Install Go using `brew install go`
   - Restart your terminal

2. **Import errors**
   - Make sure you're in the right directory
   - Check that `go.mod` exists
   - Run `go mod tidy`

3. **Permission errors**
   - Check file permissions
   - Make sure you have write access to the directory
